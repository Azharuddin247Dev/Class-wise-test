            question: "What is division?",
            answer: "Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. It is the opposite of multiplication."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the parts of a division problem?",
            answer: "In division, the number being divided is the dividend, the number dividing is the divisor, the result is the quotient, and the leftover is the remainder."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the symbol of division?",
            answer: "The symbol of division is ÷ or /."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 20 ÷ 5?",
            answer: "20 ÷ 5 = 4."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 36 ÷ 6?",
            answer: "36 ÷ 6 = 6."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the relation between multiplication and division?",
            answer: "Division is the reverse of multiplication. Example: 6 × 4 = 24, so 24 ÷ 6 = 4 and 24 ÷ 4 = 6."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the quotient in 50 ÷ 10?",
            answer: "The quotient is 5."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the remainder in 19 ÷ 4?",
            answer: "4 × 4 = 16. Remainder = 19 – 16 = 3."
        },
        {
            question: "When is the remainder zero?",
            answer: "The remainder is zero when the dividend is exactly divisible by the divisor."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 72 ÷ 9?",
            answer: "72 ÷ 9 = 8."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 100 ÷ 25?",
            answer: "100 ÷ 25 = 4."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 0 ÷ 5?",
            answer: "0 ÷ 5 = 0. Zero divided by any number is 0."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 45 ÷ 1?",
            answer: "45 ÷ 1 = 45. Any number divided by 1 is the number itself."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens when a number is divided by itself?",
            answer: "Any non-zero number divided by itself equals 1. Example: 9 ÷ 9 = 1."
        },
        {
            question: "Can we divide by zero?",
            answer: "No, division by zero is not possible. It is undefined."
        },
        {
            question: "What is long division?",
            answer: "Long division is a method of dividing large numbers step by step using dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 125 ÷ 5?",
            answer: "125 ÷ 5 = 25."
        },
        {
            question: "What is 144 ÷ 12?",
            answer: "144 ÷ 12 = 12."
        },
        {
            question: "If 7 × 8 = 56, what is 56 ÷ 7?",
            answer: "56 ÷ 7 = 8. Division checks multiplication."
        },
        {
            question: "If 9 × 9 = 81, what is 81 ÷ 9?",
            answer: "81 ÷ 9 = 9."

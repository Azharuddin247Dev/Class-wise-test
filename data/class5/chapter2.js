      question: "What is addition?",
      answer:
        "Addition is combining two or more numbers to find their total or sum.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the symbol for addition?",
      answer: "The symbol for addition is '+' (plus sign).",
    },
    {
      question: "What are addends?",
      answer:
        "Addends are the numbers being added together in an addition problem.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the sum?",
      answer:
        "The sum is the result or answer when two or more numbers are added together.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is subtraction?",
      answer:
        "Subtraction is taking away one number from another to find the difference.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the symbol for subtraction?",
      answer: "The symbol for subtraction is '-' (minus sign).",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minuend?",
      answer:
        "The minuend is the number from which another number is subtracted.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the subtrahend?",
      answer:
        "The subtrahend is the number that is subtracted from the minuend.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference?",
      answer:
        "The difference is the result when one number is subtracted from another.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is regrouping in addition?",
      answer:
        "Regrouping (or carrying) is when the sum of digits in a column is 10 or more, so we carry over to the next column.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is regrouping in subtraction?",
      answer:
        "Regrouping (or borrowing) is when we need to borrow from the next higher place value to subtract.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the commutative property of addition?",
      answer:
        "The commutative property states that changing the order of addends doesn't change the sum. Example: 3 + 5 = 5 + 3.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the associative property of addition?",
      answer:
        "The associative property states that grouping of addends doesn't change the sum. Example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4).",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the identity property of addition?",
      answer:
        "The identity property states that adding zero to any number gives the same number. Example: 7 + 0 = 7.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you check addition?",
      answer:
        "You can check addition by adding the numbers in different order or by using subtraction.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you check subtraction?",
      answer:
        "You can check subtraction by adding the difference to the subtrahend to get the minuend.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is mental math?",
      answer:
        "Mental math is doing calculations in your head without writing them down.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is estimation in addition?",
      answer:
        "Estimation in addition is rounding numbers to make addition easier and get an approximate answer.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is estimation in subtraction?",
      answer:
        "Estimation in subtraction is rounding numbers to make subtraction easier and get an approximate answer.",
    },
    {
      question: "When do we use addition in real life?",
      answer:
        "We use addition when counting money, finding total items, calculating time, and many other daily activities.",
    },

        "Ravi has 356 marbles and his friend gives him 478 more. How many marbles does Ravi have now?",

      question:
        "A shopkeeper had 1,250 pencils. He sold 786 pencils. How many pencils are left with him?",

        "A library has 2,345 books. The school bought 678 more books. How many books are there in the library now?",

        "Step 1: Difference = 1,678 - 1,235 = 443\nTherefore, Mina got 443 more votes than Rina.",

      question:
        "A fruit seller had 954 apples. He sold 328 apples in the morning and 417 in the evening. How many apples are left?",
      answer:
        "Step 1: Apples sold = 328 + 417 = 745\nStep 2: Apples left = 954 - 745 = 209\nTherefore, 209 apples are left.",

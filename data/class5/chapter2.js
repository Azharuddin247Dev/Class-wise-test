            question: "What is addition?",
            answer: "Addition is combining two or more numbers to find their total or sum."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the symbol for addition?",
            answer: "The symbol for addition is '+' (plus sign)."
        },
        {
            question: "What are addends?",
            answer: "Addends are the numbers being added together in an addition problem."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the sum?",
            answer: "The sum is the result or answer when two or more numbers are added together."
        },
        {
            question: "What is subtraction?",
            answer: "Subtraction is taking away one number from another to find the difference."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the symbol for subtraction?",
            answer: "The symbol for subtraction is '-' (minus sign)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the minuend?",
            answer: "The minuend is the number from which another number is subtracted."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the subtrahend?",
            answer: "The subtrahend is the number that is subtracted from the minuend."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference?",
            answer: "The difference is the result when one number is subtracted from another."
        },
        {
            question: "What is regrouping in addition?",
            answer: "Regrouping (or carrying) is when the sum of digits in a column is 10 or more, so we carry over to the next column."
        },
        {
            question: "What is regrouping in subtraction?",
            answer: "Regrouping (or borrowing) is when we need to borrow from the next higher place value to subtract."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the commutative property of addition?",
            answer: "The commutative property states that changing the order of addends doesn't change the sum. Example: 3 + 5 = 5 + 3."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the associative property of addition?",
            answer: "The associative property states that grouping of addends doesn't change the sum. Example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the identity property of addition?",
            answer: "The identity property states that adding zero to any number gives the same number. Example: 7 + 0 = 7."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you check addition?",
            answer: "You can check addition by adding the numbers in different order or by using subtraction."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you check subtraction?",
            answer: "You can check subtraction by adding the difference to the subtrahend to get the minuend."
        },
        {
            question: "What is mental math?",
            answer: "Mental math is doing calculations in your head without writing them down."
        },
        {
            question: "What is estimation in addition?",
            answer: "Estimation in addition is rounding numbers to make addition easier and get an approximate answer."
        },
        {
            question: "What is estimation in subtraction?",
            answer: "Estimation in subtraction is rounding numbers to make subtraction easier and get an approximate answer."
        },
        {
            question: "When do we use addition in real life?",
            answer: "We use addition when counting money, finding total items, calculating time, and many other daily activities."

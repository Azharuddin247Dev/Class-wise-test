      question: "What is multiplication?",
      answer:
        "Multiplication is repeated addition of the same number. For example, 4 × 3 means 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the symbol of multiplication?",
      answer: "The symbol of multiplication is '×'.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the numbers called in multiplication?",
      answer:
        "In multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are called factors, and the answer is called the product.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the product of 7 × 5?",
      answer: "The product of 7 × 5 is 35.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the multiplicative identity?",
      answer:
        "The multiplicative identity is 1. Multiplying any number by 1 gives the same number.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the zero property of multiplication?",
      answer: "Any number multiplied by 0 is always 0. Example: 15 × 0 = 0.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the commutative property of multiplication?",
      answer:
        "In multiplication, changing the order of numbers does not change the product. Example: 4 × 6 = 6 × 4.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the associative property of multiplication?",
      answer:
        "In multiplication, grouping of numbers does not change the product. Example: (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4).",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the distributive property?",
      answer:
        "Distributive property states that a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).",

    {
      question: "What is a multiplication table?",
      answer:
        "A multiplication table is a chart that shows the products of numbers, usually from 1 to 10 or 12.",

      answer: "4 × 6 = 24. Multiplication is commutative.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is repeated addition?",
      answer:
        "Repeated addition is adding the same number again and again. Multiplication is a shortcut for repeated addition.",

      question: "What happens when a number is multiplied by 10?",

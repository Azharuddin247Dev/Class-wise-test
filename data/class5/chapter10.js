        },
        {
            question: "What is the frequency of data?",
            answer: "Frequency is the number of times a particular data value occurs."
        },
        {
            question: "What is an advantage of a bar graph?",
            answer: "It makes comparison of different data easy and clear."
        },

        {
            question: "What is raw data?",
            answer: "Raw data is the unorganized data collected from surveys or experiments."
        },
        {
            question: "How is data organized after collection?",
            answer: "Data is organized using tables, tally marks, pictographs, and bar graphs."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the key in a pictograph?",
            answer: "The key in a pictograph shows the value of each symbol or picture."

            question: "What is the cube of a number?",
            answer: "The cube of a number is the number multiplied by itself three times. For example, 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a perfect cube?",
            answer: "A perfect cube is a number that is the cube of an integer. Examples: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125."
        },
        {
            question: "Cube of 5?",

        {
            question: "What is a cube root?",
            answer: "The cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. For example, ∛27 = 3."
        },
        {
            question: "Cube root of 64?",
            answer: "∛64 = 4 because 4 × 4 × 4 = 64."

        {
            question: "Properties of cubes?",
            answer: "Cube of positive numbers is positive, cube of negative numbers is negative, 0³ = 0."
        },
        {
            question: "Cube root of a negative number?",
            answer: "It is negative. For example, ∛(-8) = -2."

        {
            question: "Relationship between cubes and cube roots?",
            answer: "They are inverse operations. Cubing a number and taking its cube root gives the original number."

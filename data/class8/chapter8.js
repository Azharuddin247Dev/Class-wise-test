            question: "What is ratio?",
            answer: "A ratio is a comparison of two quantities of the same kind using division. Example: If 8 apples to 4 oranges, ratio = 8:4 = 2:1."
        },
        {
            question: "What is proportion?",
            answer: "Proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal. Example: 2/3 = 4/6."

        {
            question: "What is percentage?",
            answer: "Percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. Example: 45% = 45/100."

            question: "How to convert a decimal to percentage?",
            answer: "Multiply the decimal by 100. Example: 0.6 = 0.6 × 100 = 60%."

        {
            question: "What is profit?",
            answer: "Profit is the amount gained when selling price is more than cost price. Profit = Selling Price – Cost Price."

        {
            question: "What is loss?",

            question: "What is loss percentage?",
            answer: "Loss % = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100."
        },
        {
            question: "What is simple interest?",
            answer: "Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100."

        {
            question: "What is principal?",
            answer: "Principal is the initial amount of money borrowed or invested."

        {
            question: "What is rate of interest?",
            answer: "Rate is the percentage charged per year on the principal."
        },
        {
            question: "What is time in simple interest?",
            answer: "Time is the period for which money is borrowed or invested, usually in years."
        },
        {
            question: "How to compare quantities using ratio and proportion?",
            answer: "We can write ratios of quantities and solve equations to find unknowns."

        {
            question: "Real-life example of simple interest?",
            answer: "Bank loans, savings accounts, or lending money to friends."
        },
        {
            question: "Difference between ratio and proportion?",
            answer: "Ratio compares two quantities; proportion states that two ratios are equal."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is comparing quantities important?",
            answer: "It helps in financial calculations, business decisions, and understanding relationships between values."

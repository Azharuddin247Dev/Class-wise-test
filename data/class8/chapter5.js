            question: "What is data?",
            answer: "Data is a collection of facts, figures, or information that can be organized and analyzed."
        },
        {
            question: "What is data handling?",
            answer: "Data handling is the process of collecting, organizing, presenting, and interpreting data."
        },
        {
            question: "What are types of data?",
            answer: "Data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (numerical)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a frequency table?",
            answer: "A frequency table lists data values along with the number of times each value occurs."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a bar graph?",
            answer: "A bar graph uses rectangular bars to represent data values, with the length of each bar proportional to the value."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a pictograph?",
            answer: "A pictograph uses symbols or pictures to represent data, where each symbol represents a fixed number of items."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a histogram?",
            answer: "A histogram is a type of bar graph that represents frequency distribution of continuous data using adjacent bars."
        },
        {
            question: "What is mean?",
            answer: "Mean is the average of data, calculated by dividing the sum of all data values by the number of values."
        },
        {
            question: "Example of mean calculation?",
            answer: "For data 2, 4, 6, 8: Mean = (2+4+6+8)/4 = 20/4 = 5."
        },
        {
            question: "What is median?",
            answer: "Median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order."
        },
        {
            question: "How to find median of even number of observations?",
            answer: "Median is the average of the two middle values."
        },
        {
            question: "What is mode?",
            answer: "Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the data."
        },
        {
            question: "How to represent data using a pie chart?",
            answer: "Divide a circle into sectors, each sector proportional to the data value."
        },
        {
            question: "What is probability?",
            answer: "Probability is the chance of an event occurring, expressed as a fraction between 0 and 1."
        },
        {
            question: "Probability of tossing a head?",
            answer: "1/2, since there are two possible outcomes: head or tail."
        },
        {
            question: "Probability of rolling a 4 on a die?",
            answer: "1/6, as a die has six faces."
        },
        {
            question: "Difference between bar graph and histogram?",
            answer: "Bar graph is for discrete data, histogram is for continuous data with adjacent bars."
        },
        {
            question: "Real-life examples of data handling?",
            answer: "Student marks, temperature records, population statistics."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is data handling important?",
            answer: "It helps in making decisions, understanding trends, and solving real-life problems."
        },
        {
            question: "How to choose an appropriate graph?",
            answer: "Depends on type of data and what we want to compare or show."

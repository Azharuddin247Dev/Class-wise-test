            question: "What is a square of a number?",
            answer: "The square of a number is the number multiplied by itself. For example, 5² = 5 × 5 = 25."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a perfect square?",
            answer: "A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer. Examples: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25."
        },
        {
            question: "Square of 12?",

        {
            question: "What is a square root?",
            answer: "The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, √25 = 5."
        },
        {
            question: "Square root of 81?",
            answer: "√81 = 9 because 9 × 9 = 81."
        },
        {
            question: "Properties of squares?",
            answer: "Squares of positive numbers are positive, squares of negative numbers are positive, 0² = 0."
        },
        {
            question: "Methods to find square roots?",
            answer: "Prime factorization, division method, and estimation method."

        {
            question: "What is the square root of a negative number?",
            answer: "It is not a real number. It is imaginary."
        },
        {
            question: "Relationship between squares and square roots?",
            answer: "They are inverse operations. Squaring a number and then taking square root gives the original number."
        },
        {
            question: "How to check if a number is a perfect square?",
            answer: "Try prime factorization or see if the square root is an integer."

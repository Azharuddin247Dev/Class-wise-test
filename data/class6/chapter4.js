            question: "What is a point in geometry?",
            answer: "A point is an exact location in space. It has no length, breadth, or thickness."
        },
        {
            question: "How is a point represented?",
            answer: "A point is usually represented by a dot and named with a capital letter like A, B, C."

        {
            question: "What is a line?",
            answer: "A line is a straight path that extends endlessly in both directions. It has no endpoints."
        },

        {
            question: "What are intersecting lines?",

        },
        {
            question: "What are parallel lines?",
            answer: "Two lines in a plane that never meet, however far they are extended, are called parallel lines."

        {
            question: "What is a curve?",
            answer: "A curve is a drawing that is not necessarily straight. It can be open or closed."

        {
            question: "What is a polygon?",

        {
            question: "What is a triangle?",
            answer: "A triangle is a polygon with three sides, three vertices, and three angles."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a quadrilateral?",
            answer: "A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides, four vertices, and four angles."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a circle?",
            answer: "A circle is a set of points in a plane that are at the same distance from a fixed point called the center."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the radius of a circle?",
            answer: "The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on it."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the diameter of a circle?",
            answer: "The diameter is the longest chord of the circle, passing through the center. Diameter = 2 Ã— radius."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a chord of a circle?",
            answer: "A chord is a line segment that joins two points on the circle."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the boundary of a circle called?",
            answer: "The boundary of a circle is called its circumference."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the center of a circle?",
            answer: "The center of a circle is the fixed point that is equidistant from all points on the circle."
        },
        {
            question: "Name a polygon with 5 sides.",
            answer: "A polygon with 5 sides is called a pentagon."

            question: "Name a polygon with 6 sides.",
            answer: "A polygon with 6 sides is called a hexagon."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between open and closed figures?",
            answer: "An open figure does not enclose any space, while a closed figure forms an enclosed region."
